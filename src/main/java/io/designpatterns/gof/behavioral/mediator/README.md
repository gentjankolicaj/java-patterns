* In OOP the mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.This
  pattern is
  considered
  to be a behavioral pattern du to the way it can alter programs running behavior.
* With the mediator pattern
  communication between objects is encapsulated within mediator object.Objects no longer communicate
  directly with each
  other,but instead
  communicate through a mediator.This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects,
  thereby reducing coupling.
